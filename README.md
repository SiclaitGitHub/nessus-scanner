<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>


Nessus is a widely used vulnerability scanning tool developed by Tenable Network Security. It is designed to identify potential security vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, and applications. Nessus helps organizations assess their security posture and identify areas that may be susceptible to attacks or exploitation.

The tool operates by scanning target systems and devices, searching for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and potential weaknesses. It uses a comprehensive database of known vulnerabilities, which is regularly updated, to compare the configuration and state of a system against a set of security checks.

This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />

1. Set up your Azure Virtual Machine (Windows 10)

Azure is a cloud computing platform and service offered by Microsoft. It provides a wide range of cloud services that enable organizations to build, deploy, and manage applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers.

A virtual machine (VM) on Microsoft Azure is a computing resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps. Each VM instance can run its own operating system (OS), which means multiple VMs can run different operating systems on the same physical machine.

Create a new Azure resource group, virtual network, subnet and virtual machine running Windows 10. Choose a VM size according to your needs. Once the VM is set up, you will need to connect to it using Remote Desktop. For this, you'll need the public IP address of the VM and the credentials you provided during the VM setup.
